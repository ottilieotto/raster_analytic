# let's size these to small dimensions for reference for now.... maybe size of a quarter. no real info in the image. 

#RGB
plotRGB(ortho.4band, r = 3, g = 2, b = 1,

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## I suggest a melt of the dataframe before we make histograms and boxplots for computational efficiency but this will need some work

# library(reshape2)
# db <- as.data.frame(ortho.4band, na.rm = T)
# mdb <- melt(db, id.vars=rownames(db), value.name = "value", variable.name=colnames(db))
